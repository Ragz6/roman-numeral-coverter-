This project is a Roman Numeral Converter built inside a calculator-like interface. The interface includes a display screen where users can see the numbers they input and their corresponding Roman numeral conversions. Here's how it works:

Calculator Interface: The interface resembles a typical calculator, with buttons for numbers 0-9, basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and a clear button (C) to reset the input.

Input and Output Display: Users can input numbers by clicking on the calculator keys, and the entered number is displayed on the calculator screen in real-time. After conversion, both the entered number and its Roman numeral equivalent are displayed on the screen.

Conversion Functionality: The conversion from numbers to Roman numerals is handled by a JavaScript function. When the "Convert" button is clicked, the entered number is processed, and its Roman numeral equivalent is calculated and displayed.

Validation: The project includes validation to ensure that only valid numbers within a specified range (1-10000) can be converted. If an invalid number is entered, appropriate error messages are displayed on the screen.

Overall, this project provides a user-friendly interface for converting numbers to Roman numerals, making it easy for users to understand and interact with the conversion process.
